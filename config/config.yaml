# FASTQ naming: sample ID is the prefix before the read-pair suffix
# Using .1. / .2. allows underscores in sample names (e.g. genotype_target_replicate)
# These suffixes are used only for sample discovery and trim rule inputs.
# Trimmed outputs are always {sample}.cut.1.fq.gz / {sample}.cut.2.fq.gz regardless.
